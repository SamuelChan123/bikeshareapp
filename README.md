### BikeShare Data Analysis

# Project By Samuel Chan as Part of Capital One's "Build a web app that analyzes bike share data" Challenge

**Used Jekyll Theme "Forty" in Github Pages**

**Ran SQL queries against a PostgreSQL 10 SQL database constructed almost exactly (with the exclusion of the last two columns) as the data set provided.**

_Postgres was installed on a Ubuntu 14.04 Virtual Machine using vagrant and VirtualBox_
_In the SQL folder, create.sql gives the schema for the SQL database, load.sql is run by setup.sh to load the created db with data from the .csv file provided._
