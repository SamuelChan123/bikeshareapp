#### Project By Samuel Chan as Part of Capital One's "Build a web app that analyzes bike share data" Challenge

* Used Jekyll Theme "Forty" in Github Pages, Jekyll is an extendable site generator as well as a Ruby Gem

* Ran SQL queries against a PostgreSQL 10 SQL database constructed almost exactly (with the exclusion of the last two columns) as the data set provided

* Postgres was installed on a Ubuntu 14.04 Virtual Machine using vagrant and VirtualBox

* Project was tested via the Jekyll executable in the command line for development locally

## Structure:
* _In the SQL folder, create.sql gives the schema for the SQL database, load.sql is run by the setup.sh script (called with ./setup.sh) to load the created db with data from the .csv file provided._
